# Standards-Compliant, Class-Managed Swipe Display

If you can:

	1. address a list of HTML links to your image files,
	2. add classes to HTML to manage & configure the display, and
	3. post the art & pages to the web,

you can establish a swipe display compliant to HTML4 &amp; 5 for screen, tablet &amp; mobile.

The display is based on the presentation of the [Thrillbent online comics](http://thrillbent.com), which Mark Waid &amp; his team of creators credit [Yves Bigerel's turbomedia challenge](http://www.deviantart.com/balak01/art/about-DIGITAL-COMICS-111966969) as inspiration. Requires [jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery/) starting at version 2.
