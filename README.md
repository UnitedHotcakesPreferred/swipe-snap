# Swipe &amp; Snap Display. Just Add Images.

If you can:

	1. edit an HTML list of links to your image files,
	2. add class values to HTML to customize your display, and
	3. post the art & pages to the web,

you can give readers a swipe display compliant to HTML4 &amp; 5. Support for the display begins in browsers that support [jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery/) version 2.

This solution is based on the [Thrillbent comics](http://thrillbent.com) display, which Mark Waid &amp; his team of creators credit [Yves Bigerel's turbomedia comics challenge](http://www.deviantart.com/balak01/art/about-DIGITAL-COMICS-111966969) has inspiration. Take a look at the sample html to see how easy it is to give what you have to say a swipe display.
